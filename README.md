# Work Day Scheduler

[Launch Workday Planner]()

## Overview
This week's homework we were tasked to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## Application Functionality

When the user opens the daily planner application to create a schedule, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. The user is presented with time blocks for each hour in a standard business hours of the day and each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks into a time block they can enter an event, and when they click the save button for that time block the text will be saved to the browser's local storage so when the page is refreshed the save events persist.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Application Specifications

This app run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Additionally, the application uses [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) as the date utility library to work with date and time.
